        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have been programming for 7 years now, but have only been developing games for the last 3 years. It has
            quickly become my favourite thing to do, however!
            I have been specialising in game physics and AI (not generative AI) for the last year now, and I absolutely
            love it. Creating AI
            behaviour that feels responsive and realistic feels fantastic!
